- Halpern et al (2014) Assessing the health of the U.S. west coast with a regional-scale application of the Ocean Health Index. _PLOS One_.

The folders correspond to:

- **conf**: configuration files
- **layers**: input data used to calculate the dimensions (pressures, resilience, status and trend) of each goal
- **scores**: output scores
- **spatial**: vector (shapefile) and raster (GeoTIFF) formats of the regions used

NOTE: The message in gray text to the right of the file or folder corresponds with the message associated with the most recent [commit](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-uswest/commits/master), hence reflecting status of overall repository at that time and not necessarily the individual state of the file.
